# Summary

Hi~ï¼ŒI did some fuzzy testing and found some bugs/vulnerabilities on cute_png v1.05. I hope these findings will help improve software quality.



All of the bugs/vulnerabilities trigger no assertion before bug/vulnerability. Only one bug/vulnerability triggers assertion after stack overflow. This means that these bugs/vulnerabilities are unexpected behaviors of the program. A sheet for it is shown below.
